Air quality index (AQI) prediction is an important problem in environmental engineering and public health, as it allows policymakers and individuals to take appropriate actions to reduce exposure to air pollution. Having the possibility to predict the trend that pollution will allow to study the future pollutant levels and extract patterns. With all that information it is possible to take the necessary actions to reduce the exposure and take care of the public health.
In this project, we proposed a machine learning approach for AQI prediction using data from multiple cities across India. Our model is trained on a large dataset of daily pollutants measurements from multiple locations, and is able to make accurate predictions for future AQI values up to 2 months in advance. Our proposed system is formed by an attention mechanism in combination with an LSTM+CNN model. We compare the performance of our model to other
state-of-the-art approaches and show that it achieves superior results in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness.
Our approach has the potential to improve air quality forecasting and help mitigate the negative impacts of air pollution on human health and the environment.
